## v0.2.0 — First executable browser prototype (2026-10-09)
### Added
- `index.html` entry, `styles.css`, `src/sim-model.js`, `src/app.js`
- PB980-inspired teaching surface; settings increment/decrement and help text
- right-side CIRCUIT concept views (parts, assembly overview, complete schematic)
- Node built-in regression tests, npm scripts

### Changed
- README updated to reflect executable preview and non-clinical boundaries
- Roadmap re-ordered to prioritize browser release, UI inspection, real-device reference review

### Risks / Known issues
- reference measurements and waveforms are intentionally STATIC; do not interpret as patient response
- adjustment increments and ranges are not vendor-validated
- diagram is not a real assembly instruction
- PB980 exact UI geometry and function verification pending
- no physical-device browser acceptance test yet

### Next
- PB980 official GUI/controls/parameter reference check
- interactive SVG waveform driven by separately documented educational lung model
- visual regression checks / responsive browser validation
- GitHub Pages configuration after visibility/access decision
